<p align="left">This program was originally written to make banners for the Internet. Most
places that except banners wanted them in standard sizes. This is why the sizes in the
&quot;Banner size&quot; list box look strange.</p>

<p align="left">However, since adding the shaded border I have used it mostly for making
buttons for the web and my programs. The buttons used in this help file are made with the
program and are included as samples. The program was pretty well written before I added
the shaded border so the buttons are normal windows buttons. I did not feel like changing
the look of the program so I left the buttons as standard.</p>

<p>Feel free to use and modify this code but do not sell the program. It is offered as a
free personnel tool and tutorial. If modified and reposted please give me a little credit.
</p>

<p>Right now I don't feel like improving on it any more, that is why I am putting it on
PSC.</p>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#FF0000">Add another graphic so you can have one on each side of the banner</font></li>
  <li><font color="#FF0000">Break up the redraw routine into several smaller routines. It
    would be easier to follow the code.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#FF0000">Add multi line text. On a tall thin banner the program right now
    does a terrible job.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#FF0000">Incorporate the shadow size in the text alignment</font></li>
  <li><font color="#FF0000">Reload the tile graphic because once all white or all black is
    reached&nbsp; or close then going in the other direction will not bring back the pattern.</font></li>
</ul>
